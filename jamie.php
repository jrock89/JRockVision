      <p class="info_about">
        I picked up my first camera in the 9th grade. In the beginning, I was simply taking photos for my friends and myself, but after some time I started seeing a very positive reaction to the photos and video that I had captured. To make people happy like this and see the smiles on their faces was like no other feeling, and I knew that this was something I wanted to pursue. I would always go to the local skate park in my hometown Saratoga Springs, NY, to take photos and videos while my friends would ride. I would be there for hours on end until the battery died in my camera.  My friend Dan, who is now the vice president of JRV, was always there by my side and one day he decided to pick a camera up for himself. It came to me as I was helping him learn the ropes that this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Not only would I start my own production/ photography business but I would use this business as a platform in a revolution to help younger kids get experience in the field of production life.      </p>
