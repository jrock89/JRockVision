      <p class="info_about">
        My name is Laura Hogan and I’m a photographer here at Jrockvision. I became interested in pursuing a career in photography a little ways down the road from meeting jamie. In fact, up until that point in time I had only ever been in front of the camera, getting my picture taken instead of being behind it taking the picture. However, I started questioning what was so special about being behind the camera after assisting jamie at many photoshoots. At every photoshoot I used to ask myself,  “ How can he be working and still his smile never leaves his face?” I decided to make jamie my mentor, learn a few things about the camera and photography itself until the day I picked the camera up myself. That day, the day of my first photoshoot, I fell in love with photography. I came to an epiphany that behind the camera I am able to capture memories that clients will be able to look back at and cherish for the rest of their lives. I’m able to capture what a photoshoot feels like instead of what is looks like. And theres no better feeling than knowing years down the road when my clients are gathered around a kitchen table reminiscing on old times and looking at pictures, I was able to help capture those moments. And that is why i’m behind the camera.      </p>
